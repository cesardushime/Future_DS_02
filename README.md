# Loan Approval Prediction Model

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a Loan Approval Prediction Model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on various factors, including applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and more. The model has achieved an accuracy of **83%**, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting loan approvals.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library
- **StandardScaler**: For data scaling
- **LabelEncoder**: For converting categorical data to numeric values

## Data Exploration

In this phase, the dataset was examined to understand the underlying patterns and relationships between variables. Key statistics were gathered to inform data preprocessing steps.

## Data Preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Values**: Implemented imputation techniques to fill in missing data.
- **Outlier Detection**: Normalization was used to fix outliers and improve model performance.
- **Data Scaling**: Features were scaled to ensure uniformity and better accuracy during model training.

## Model Training

The model was trained using various algorithms from scikit-learn, including:
- Decision Trees
- Naive Bayes

The dataset was split into 80% for training and 20% for testing sets to evaluate the model's performance effectively.

## Evaluation Metrics

Model performance was evaluated using accuracy metrics to ensure reliable predictions. The final model achieved an accuracy of **83%** on the test dataset.
